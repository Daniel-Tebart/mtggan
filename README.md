In this repo a generative adverserial network (gan) for creating novel magic the gathering (mtg) is constructed. The rough pipeline will be

1.) Data gathering
2.) Data processing
3.) Modeling/Testing Cycle
4.) Present results

The generative models will be build for separate parts of the cards and at the end I will be putting everything together. The following order is designated:

1.) Generating art images
2.) Generating rule text
3.) Generating art and rule text together
